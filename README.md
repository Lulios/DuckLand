# DuckLand
This is a little VR game on the theme of ducks and amusement parks. It was developed as a student project at the UQAC (Université du Québec à Chicoutimi) for the 3D interaction and virtual reality course with the aim to propose a rehabilitation tool for people who suffered arm injuries or hemiplegia.

The game consists of two mini-games around rubber ducks, which are presented below.

## Duck Fishing
The goal of this mini-game is to catch as many ducks as possible with a fishing rod. Each duck is worth one point. Once a duck is caught by the fishing hook, the player must lift it high enough to get the point.

There is two difficulty modes. When the hard mode is enabled, the height the player must bring a caught duck to obtain the point is increased.

A scoreboard allows you to keep track of the score.

## Whack-A-Duck
This game is based, as its name suggests, on the Whack-A-Mole game. Some ducks will appear in a basin and the player would need to touch their heads after they emerged from the water and before they dive back in. Each duck is worth one point.

There is two difficulty modes. When the hard mode is enabled, some ducks will give more points, but they will be faster and therefore more difficult to get.

A scoreboard allows you to keep track of the score.
